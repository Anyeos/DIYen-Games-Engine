# DIYen-Games-Engine

Do It Yourself Games Engine is a 2D videogame engine inspired by DIV Games Studio developed under Free Pascal Compiler.

The purpose of this is to create a modern version of the concepts that was used in the DOS version of the game creation suite called DIV.

It is more suitable to make Arcade games because it uses old school concepts that works great and fast and are easy to understand. It will let you make any Arcade style game almost in seconds.


Actually it lack of documentation but there are a few articles that will explain you something.


First you will need some additional software to make the "sprites" and define collisions. DIYen have a dedicated software called "DIYen FPG list Editor" to do the job.

You will need to create Bitmap fonts too, there are another tool called "DIYen Font Editor".

And the rest is code. You will need "Lazarus" to have an IDE for code and compile your proyect. Lazarus is a Delphi like IDE for Free Pascal that you can get from https://www.lazarus-ide.org
